# PIMS
Pipeline Interface and Management System

PIMS is designed to make bioinformatics (and other) pipelines easy to create and edit, while keeping records of the work done. For usage, see the full manual (available online). At present, the most extensive testing has taken place on Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 2.7.6. The author does not guarantee any degree of functionality on any computer or operating system. While PIMS has been designed to be as flexible as possible, and is compatible with all command line tools tested, the author does not guarantee that every piece of software is compatible. If you find a piece of software that does not work with this, please contact the author.
